# 1.1.1.Alpha

This version is a development preview and not recommended for production use. Please give feedback to help
stabilize and improve the next version.

## New and Noteworthy

- rename `cache2k-impl` to `cache2k-core`. I think that is more intuitive for containing the 
  actual "core" cache implementation in case there are more `cache2k-xy` jars in the classpath.
